Hi there üëã I'm Ombeline, an aspiring cybersecurity engineer and 42 student.

## About Me

I'm a quick learner passionate about programming, AI, and VR. Currently diving deep into C and cybersecurity through project-based learning at 42.

When I'm not coding, you can find me singing, learning languages, or exploring Japanese culture.

## üíª Skills

- Technical: C, C++, Python
- Soft: Teamwork, Adaptability, Conflict Resolution
- Languages: French, English, basic Spanish and learning German

## üèÜ Projects

# Done
- Libft: Recreated standard C library functions
- Ft_printf: Built a printf function from scratch
- Get_next_line:  a function that reads a file line by line, returning the next line of text each time it's called, until reaching the end of the file.
- Born2beroot: set up a virtual server from scratch using VirtualBox and configured security features like monitoring, access controls, and updates. Practiced sysadmin skills like bash scripting, networking, and automation.
- So_long: Built a simple 2D game with MinilibX, rendering sprites and managing player movements/collisions. Focused on game loop, events, and basic AI enemies.
- Push_swap: Implemented sorting algorithms to order a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. Focused on optimization and efficiency, learning concepts like recursion and rudimentary AI techniques.
- Pipex: a program that emulates the functionality of Unix pipes. It takes input from a file, passes it through one or more commands, and outputs the result to another file.
- Philosophers: Philosophers simulates dining philosophers with threads or processes and synchronization primitives to avoid deadlock when accessing shared forks. Philosophers alternate thinking, eating, and sleeping until they die or reach a eating limit.
- Minishell (a two-person team): Minishell is a simple shell that implements basic features like pipelines, redirections, environment variables, signals, and executable execution. It aims to emulate bash while handling errors robustly.
- Cpp: a combinaison of mulitple project in order to learn the basis of Cpp.

# In progress
- Cub3d (a two-person team): a raycasting engine that renders a 3D view from a 2D map, with textures, sprites, and lighting. The goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze in first-person perspective, simulating movement.

# Up next
- ft_IRC (a two-person team): Create our own IRC server, following standard Internet RFCs.
- Inception: The aim of this project is to extend my knowledge of Docker. I will virtualize several Docker images by creating them in my new personal virtual machine.
- FINAL PROJECT: ft_transcendance (a five-person team): This project consists in creating a website to take part in a competition of the famous game Pong!
