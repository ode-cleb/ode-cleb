Hello! I'm Ombeline, a 42 student passionate about informatics in general but most particularly cybersecurity, AI and Virtual Reality. I'm not specialize yet and I enjoy discovering new things everyday. 

## About Me

I'm 22 years old woman and I started my journey in Informatics with the 42 in july 2022. Since then I have learned a lot: C and C++ language of course, but also how to work by myself, how to start a project from NULL with no notion and how to work with other in order to have a beautiful result at the end, matching the expectation.
I have a passion for Japanese Culture in all its shapes. I love singing and learning new languages.

## Skills

- Technical: C, C++, Python
- Soft: Teamwork, Adaptability, Conflict Resolution
- Languages: French, English, basic Spanish and learning German

## Projects

Done:
- Libft: a library of the essential basis C function.
- Ft_printf: my own version of printf
- Get_next_line:  a function that reads a file line by line, returning the next line of text each time it's called, until reaching the end of the file.
- Born2beroot: First approach of System Administation. Use of Virtual Box.
- So_long: First graphic project where I created a mini 2D game.
- Push_swap: This project required me to sort data within a stack using a limited set of instructions and with minimal operations.
- Pipex: a program that emulates the functionality of Unix pipes. It takes input from a file, passes it through one or more commands, and outputs the result to another file.
- Philosophers: Philosophers simulates dining philosophers with threads or processes and synchronization primitives to avoid deadlock when accessing shared forks. Philosophers alternate thinking, eating, and sleeping until they die or reach a eating limit.
- Minishell (a two-person team): Minishell is a simple shell that implements basic features like pipelines, redirections, environment variables, signals, and executable execution. It aims to emulate bash while handling errors robustly.
- Cpp: a combinaison of mulitple project in order to learn the basis of Cpp.

Currently Doing:
- Cub3d (a two-person team): a raycasting engine that renders a 3D view from a 2D map, with textures, sprites, and lighting. The goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze in first-person perspective, simulating movement.

Futur project:
- ft_IRC (a two-person team): Create our own IRC server, following standard Internet RFCs.
- Inception: The aim of this project is to extend my knowledge of Docker. I will virtualize several Docker images by creating them in my new personal virtual machine.
- FINAL PROJECT: ft_transcendance (a five-person team): This project consists in creating a website to take part in a competition of the famous game Pong!
